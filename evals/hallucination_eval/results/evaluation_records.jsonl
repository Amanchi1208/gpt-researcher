Given that ambiguity is a feature and not a bug in Generative AI design, it\u2019s sometimes difficult for engineers to figure out where to even start. We have created a set of human-centric UX Design Principles to enable developers to build customer-centric agentic systems to solve their business needs. These design principles are not a prescriptive architecture but rather a starting point for teams who are defining and building out agent experiences.\nIn general, agents should:\nBroaden and scale human capacities (brainstorming, problem-solving, automation, etc.)\nFill in knowledge gaps (get me up-to-speed on knowledge domains, translation, etc.)\nFacilitate and support collaboration in the ways we as individuals prefer to work with others\n\nSource: https://github.com/vasundras/agentic-ai-playbook\nTitle: GitHub - vasundras/agentic-ai-playbook: A curated collection of resources, frameworks, and practical implementations for building and understanding Agentic AI systems.

Given that ambiguity is a feature and not a bug in Generative AI design, it\u2019s sometimes difficult for engineers to figure out where to even start. We have created a set of human-centric UX Design Principles to enable developers to build customer-centric agentic systems to solve their business needs. These design principles are not a prescriptive architecture but rather a starting point for teams who are defining and building out agent experiences.\nIn general, agents should:\nBroaden and scale human capacities (brainstorming, problem-solving, automation, etc.)\nFill in knowledge gaps (get me up-to-speed on knowledge domains, translation, etc.)\nFacilitate and support collaboration in the ways we as individuals prefer to work with others\n\nSource: https://github.com/vasundras/agentic-ai-playbook\nTitle: GitHub - vasundras/agentic-ai-playbook: A curated collection of resources, frameworks, and practical implementations for building and understanding Agentic AI systems.

AgentAI enhances scalability, robustness, and flexibility by utilizing advanced communication, learning, and decision-making capabilities, making it integral to diverse applications in Industry 4.0. The ability of AI systems to interpret sensory data in open-world environments has seen significant advancements in recent years. This progress emphasizes the need to move beyond reductionist approaches and embrace more embodied and cohesive systems, which integrate foundational models into agent-driven actions. Existing surveys often focus on isolated domains or specific autonomy levels, lacking a cohesive analysis that spans the full spectrum of AgentAI development in Industry 4.0. This survey explicitly fills this gap by introducing a multi-domain taxonomy and by", "is_hallucination": true, "confidence_score": true, "reasoning": "The summary claims to provide a comprehensive report on resources for learning agent-based design in AI in 2025. However, the document primarily lists various online courses, frameworks, and resources related to AI agents, without explicitly stating that it is a comprehensive report. The summary also mentions a prediction by McKinsey about agentic AI automating up to 70% of knowledge work tasks by 2030, which is not directly found in the document. These elements suggest that the summary contains non-factual or hallucinated information that cannot be directly inferred from the document."}}

This makes them attractive for developer tools and automation.\n- **Llama 3.2\u20138B** is also strong, but slightly behind DeepSeek and Mistral in code-specific tasks.\n\n### 4. **Instruction-Following and Dialogue**\n- **Qwen 2.5\u20137B** stands out for its instruction-following and conversational abilities, making it well-suited for chatbots and multilingual applications.\n- **Llama 3.2\u20138B** and **Mistral 7B** are also robust in dialogue, especially when fine-tuned.\n\n### 5. **Efficiency and Deployment**\n- All models in this category are designed for efficient inference, with context windows of 32K to 128K tokens, enabling long document processing and multi-turn conversations.\n- **Mistral 7B** and **Falcon 7B** are particularly noted for their speed and low latency, making them ideal for real-time applications ([Sulbha Jain, 2025](https://medium.com/@sulbha.jindal/top-open-source-llms-small-and-mid-range-in-2025-ff8ea8df8738); [n8n Blog, 2025](https://blog.n8n.io/open-source-llm/)).\n\n---\n\n## Hardware and Cost Considerations\n\n- **Memory Requirements:** Most 7B\u20138B models require 8\u201316GB of RAM or VRAM for inference. Quantized versions (4-bit, 8-bit) can run on consumer GPUs or even high-end CPUs with 4\u20138GB RAM for simple tasks ([n8n Blog, 2025](https://blog.n8n.io/open-source-llm/)).\n- **Inference Speed:** On standard consumer hardware (e.g., RTX 4090), these models can achieve 30\u201360 tokens per second. On specialized hardware (Groq LPU, Cerebras CS-3), speeds are much higher ([Artificial Analysis, 2025](https://artificialanalysis.ai/leaderboards/models)).\n- **Cost:** Running these models locally is free after hardware investment. Cloud/VPS costs for a GPU instance start at $1\u2013$2/hour for 7B\u20138B models ([n8n Blog, 2025](https://blog.n8n.io/open-source-llm/)).\n\n---\n\n## Security, Licensing, and Community Support\n\n- **Licensing:** Most models use permissive licenses (Apache 2.0, MIT), though some (e.g., Meta\u2019s Llama 3) have non-commercial restrictions.\n- **Security:** Open weights increase transparency but also expand the attack surface (data poisoning, prompt injection). Community best practices recommend gating access and internal deployment ([n8n Blog, 2025](https://blog.n8n.io/open-source-llm/)).\n- **Community:** All leading models have active communities, frequent updates, and extensive documentation, facilitating rapid adoption and troubleshooting.\n\n---\n\n## Opinion and Synthesis\n\nBased on the most recent and reliable data, **Llama 3.2\u20138B** and **DeepSeek 7B** are the best all-around open-source LLMs under 10B parameters in 2025. They offer the strongest balance of general reasoning, code generation, and efficiency, with benchmark scores rivaling much larger models from previous years. **Mistral 7B** is the top choice for customization and code-centric applications, while **Qwen 2.5\u20137B** is ideal for multilingual chatbots. **Falcon 7B** excels in real-time, low-latency scenarios.\n\nThe gap between these open models and proprietary giants has narrowed dramatically. For most enterprise, research, and developer use cases, deploying a well-chosen 7B\u20138B model is now a practical, cost-effective, and high-performance solution.\n\n---\n\n## References\n\n- n8n Blog.

It helps benchmark how efficiently the model handles different types of inputs.\nToken Per Second (TPS)\nTPS refers to the number of tokens\nthat a LLM can generate or process in one second. A higher TPS indicates faster model responses.\nTPS is generally calculated using the formula:\nTPS = (Input Tokens + Output Tokens) / Total Turnaround Time (TAT in seconds)\nThis value represents the\naverage TPS\n, accounting for both the input and output tokens over the total time taken.\nHowever, it\u2019s also important to evaluate\nOutput TPS\n, which specifically measures how many tokens the model generates per second, independent of the input tokens.\nOutput TPS can be calculated as:\nOutput TPS = Output Tokens / Time to Generate Output Tokens (TAT in seconds)\n\nSource: https://rumn.medium.com/benchmarking-llm-performance-token-per-second-tps-time-to-first-token-ttft-and-gpu-usage-8c50ee8387fa\nTitle: Benchmarking LLMs: TPS, TTFT,  GPU Usage | Medium\nContent: Understanding the Key Performance Metrics\nPhoto by Nataliya Vaitkevich\nRunning LLMs in production comes down to one main thing \u2014 how fast can you get responses from your model (besides accuracy, obviously!). To get the fastest responses, you need solid infrastructure (GPUs and such), but let\u2019s be real \u2014 you can\u2019t just pick the fanciest GPU out there. You need to find something that fits your budget.\nTo figure out what infrastructure you\u2019ll need for your LLM deployment without breaking the bank, let\u2019s look at some key metrics that\u2019ll help you make the right choice:\nTime to first token (TTFT)\nIt refers to the amount of time an LLM takes to generate the first token in its response after receiving an input or prompt. It is typically measured in seconds or milliseconds, and a lower TTFT indicates faster model responsiveness.\nWhy TTFT Matters for Performance Benchmarking?\n\nSource: https://llm-stats.com/\nTitle: LLM Leaderboard 2025 - Verified AI Rankings\nContent: LLM Leaderboard 2025 - Verified AI Rankings\nLLM Rankings\nBest models and API providers in each category\nFollow on X\nReal-time model updates & benchmark alerts\nNEW\nJoin Discord\nFind insights, ask questions, and get help\nBenchmarks\nLeaderboards about code, reasoning and general knowledge\nContext Window\nMaximum input context length for each model\nWhile tokenization varies between models, on average, 1 token \u2248 3.5 characters in English.\nNote: Each model uses its own tokenizer, so actual token counts may vary significantly.\nAs a rough guide, 1 million tokens is approximately equivalent to:\n30 hours\nof a podcast\n~150 words per minute\n1,000 pages\nof a book\n~500 words per page\n60,000 lines\n1\nof code\n~60 characters per line\n[1] Based on average characters per line.

By measuring key metrics like TTFT (Time to First Token), TPS (Tokens Per Second), and GPU usage patterns, you can make informed decisions about which GPU setup will give you the best bang for your buck.\nRemember that benchmarking isn\u2019t just about running a few quick tests \u2014 it\u2019s about simulating real-world conditions. Use diverse input sizes, consider the impact of tokenizers and adapters, and always test with your actual use cases in mind. With the benchmarking script and approach we\u2019ve covered, you can confidently choose the right infrastructure that balances both performance and cost for your LLM deployment.\nIf you enjoyed this article, your applause would be greatly appreciated!\nLlm\nNLP\nPerformance Testing\nMachine Learning\nAI\nFollow\nWritten by\nRuman\n\nSource: https://rumn.medium.com/benchmarking-llm-performance-token-per-second-tps-time-to-first-token-ttft-and-gpu-usage-8c50ee8387fa\nTitle: Benchmarking LLMs: TPS, TTFT,  GPU Usage | Medium\nContent: Don\u2019t forget to clean up GPU memory between runs\n\u2705 Need the full code ?

This article provides a deep dive into five major open LLMs \u2013 their architectures, training specifics, and how they stack up on intelligence benchmarks. We examine Meta\u2019s latest\nLLaMA 3\n, the efficient\nMistral\nmodel, UAE\u2019s\nFalcon\n, community-driven models like\nOpenChat/OpenHermes\n, and new challengers like\nDeepSeek\n(with a note on\nYi\n).

Param = total parameters.\nHow LLM Intelligence is Measured\nWhen we say one model \u201coutperforms\u201d another, it\u2019s usually based on standardized\nevaluation benchmarks\n. These benchmarks test various aspects of AI capability in an apples-to-apples way. Here we explain some of the\nkey metrics and tests\ncommonly used to compare LLMs:\nMMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding):\nA benchmark of 57 diverse subjects (history, math, science, law, etc.) with over 15,000 multiple-choice questions (\nWhat Are LLM Benchmarks? | IBM\n). It evaluates the breadth and depth of a model\u2019s\nworld knowledge and problem-solving\n. Models are tested in zero-shot or few-shot mode (no fine-tune on the tasks), and the score is simply the percentage of questions answered correctly (\n\nSource: https://qlogix.blog/2025/04/04/comparing-the-top-open-source-llms-in-2025/\nTitle: Comparing the Top Open-Source LLMs in 2025\nContent: When evaluating models, it\u2019s important to consider\nwhich benchmarks matter for your use case\n. A coding assistant might prioritize HumanEval and MBPP scores. A knowledge bot might emphasize MMLU and TruthfulQA. The great thing in 2025 is that the open-source community has assembled a rich set of evaluation data and made many results public \u2013 so we have a clearer picture than ever of how these LLMs compare.\nConclusion\nThe open-source LLM ecosystem in 2025 is vibrant and quickly closing the gap with proprietary models.\nMeta\u2019s LLaMA 3\nhas set new records in openness and scale,\nMistral\nhas shown the way to efficiency, and\nFalcon\ndemonstrated that even 100B+ models can be open access. Meanwhile, community fine-tunes like\nOpenChat\nand\nOpenHermes\nprove that with clever training, smaller models can achieve remarkable chat performance. Emerging projects like\nDeepSeek\n\nSource: https://qlogix.blog/2025/04/04/comparing-the-top-open-source-llms-in-2025/\nTitle: Comparing the Top Open-Source LLMs in 2025\nContent: Hugging Face Open LLM Leaderboard\n, which ranks open-source models on a suite of benchmarks including ARC, HellaSwag, MMLU, GSM8K, TruthfulQA, and others (\nWhat Are LLM Benchmarks? | IBM\n) (\nWhat Are LLM Benchmarks? | IBM\n). Models are evaluated under identical conditions (usually 0-shot or few-shot) and the results are updated as new models are added. For instance, as of early 2025, you might see DeepSeek V3, LLaMA\u00a03.1, Falcon 180B, etc. vying for the top spots. Such leaderboards provide a quick way for developers to see which models are currently the \u201csmartest\u201d by these metrics.\nAnother popular evaluation is via\nLMSYS\u2019s Chatbot Arena\n(by the Vicuna team). This is a\ncrowd-sourced Elo rating\nsystem where real users (or a proxy like GPT-4) compare two models in a chat conversation and vote for the better response (\nWhat Are LLM Benchmarks? | IBM\n\nSource: https://qlogix.blog/2025/04/04/comparing-the-top-open-source-llms-in-2025/\nTitle: Comparing the Top Open-Source LLMs in 2025\nContent: What Are LLM Benchmarks? | IBM\n). The LMSYS Arena yields an Elo score indicating overall quality and conversational skill. Open models like Vicuna, OpenAssistant, and others were ranked here against closed models. By mid-2024, some fine-tuned open models (e.g. Vicuna-33B, etc.) had Elo scores not far from ChatGPT. The\nMT-Bench\nmentioned earlier is part of this, using GPT-4 to grade model responses on multi-turn tasks (\nWhat Are LLM Benchmarks? | IBM\n). Leaderboards like LMSYS Arena are valuable because they capture\ninteractive performance and qualitative aspects\n(like helpfulness, coherence) that static benchmarks might miss.\nWhen evaluating models, it\u2019s important to consider\nwhich benchmarks matter for your use case\n\nSource: https://qlogix.blog/2025/04/04/comparing-the-top-open-source-llms-in-2025/\nTitle: Comparing the Top Open-Source LLMs in 2025\nContent: can the model solve problems that stumped earlier LLMs?\nEach task has its own metric (accuracy, F1, etc.), but models are often ranked by how many of the 23 tasks they significantly surpass a baseline on. BBH is useful to distinguish the very best models: for instance, an advanced model might solve 15+ of the tasks, while a weaker one solves only a few. It\u2019s a measure of\nextreme generalization\nability.\nIn addition to these, many other benchmarks exist (HumanEval for coding, MT-Bench for multi-turn dialogue, Winogrande for pronoun resolution, etc.), but the above are among the most widely cited for \u201cgeneral intelligence\u201d of LLMs.\nLeaderboards and Community Evaluations\nTo keep track of the many benchmarks, researchers rely on\nLLM leaderboards\n. A leaderboard aggregates multiple test results into a ranking of models, often with an overall score. One prominent example is the\nHugging Face Open LLM Leaderboard\n\nSource: https://qlogix.blog/2025/04/04/comparing-the-top-open-source-llms-in-2025/\nTitle: Comparing the Top Open-Source LLMs in 2025\nContent: logic and arithmetic\nin LLMs. Top models in 2025 (like GPT-4 or DeepSeek) can exceed 80-90% on GSM8K, whereas earlier models were below 50%, highlighting how far reasoning has come (\nGitHub \u2013 deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3\n).\nBIG-Bench Hard (BBH):\nBIG-Bench is a large collection of challenging tasks;\nBBH\nis a curated subset of the\n23 most difficult tasks\nfrom that collection (\nLLM Benchmarks Explained: Everything on MMLU, HellaSwag, BBH, and Beyond \u2013 Confident AI\n). These tasks cover things like logical deduction, nuanced understanding, or extreme few-shot learning. They were considered \u201cbeyond the capabilities\u201d of models when released (\nLLM Benchmarks Explained: Everything on MMLU, HellaSwag, BBH, and Beyond \u2013 Confident AI\n).

These \"small\" and \"mid-range\" LLMs are increasingly favored for their deployability on modest hardware, cost-effectiveness, and strong performance on real-world tasks. As of mid-2025, several leading models\u2014such as Llama 3.2\u20138B, Mistral 7B, Qwen 2.5\u20137B, DeepSeek 7B, and Falcon 7B\u2014have emerged as top contenders in this category. This report provides a comprehensive, data-driven comparison of these models, focusing on their benchmark results, architectural innovations, and practical trade-offs, based on the latest and most reliable sources.\n\n---\n\n## The Importance of Benchmarks in LLM Evaluation\n\nBenchmarks are critical for objectively assessing LLM capabilities. The most reputable benchmarks for LLMs under 10B parameters include:\n\n- **MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding):** Measures multitask accuracy across 57 subjects.\n- **ARC (AI2 Reasoning Challenge):** Evaluates commonsense and scientific reasoning.\n- **HellaSwag:** Tests commonsense inference.\n- **GSM8K:** Focuses on mathematical reasoning with grade-school math problems.\n- **HumanEval:** Assesses code generation and problem-solving.\n- **BBH (Big-Bench Hard):** A suite of the most challenging reasoning tasks.\n\nThese benchmarks are widely used in leaderboards such as the [Hugging Face Open LLM Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/collections/open-llm-leaderboard/the-big-benchmarks-collection-64faca6335a7fc7d4ffe974a), [Vellum Open LLM Leaderboard](https://www.vellum.ai/open-llm-leaderboard), and [Artificial Analysis](https://artificialanalysis.ai/leaderboards/models), providing transparent, reproducible comparisons.\n\n---\n\n## Key Open-Source LLMs Under 10B Parameters: Overview\n\n### 1. **Llama 3.2\u20138B (Meta)**\n- **Parameters:** 8B\n- **Strengths:** General-purpose, strong reasoning, instruction-following, multilingual.\n- **Context Window:** 128K tokens\n- **Benchmarks:** Competitive on MMLU, ARC, GSM8K, and HumanEval.\n- **Notable Features:** Grouped Query Attention (GQA), efficient inference, open weights ([Sulbha Jain, 2025](https://medium.com/@sulbha.jindal/top-open-source-llms-small-and-mid-range-in-2025-ff8ea8df8738); [n8n Blog, 2025](https://blog.n8n.io/open-source-llm/)).\n\n### 2. **Mistral 7B**\n- **Parameters:** 7B\n- **Strengths:** Customization, fine-tuning, high efficiency, strong on reasoning and code.\n- **Context Window:** 32K\u201364K tokens (varies by implementation)\n- **Benchmarks:** Outperforms Llama 2 13B in several tasks; strong on HumanEval and MMLU.\n- **Notable Features:** GQA, sliding window attention, open weights ([Qlogix, 2025](https://qlogix.blog/2025/04/04/comparing-the-top-open-source-llms-in-2025/)).\n\n### 3. **Qwen 2.5\u20137B (Alibaba)**\n- **Parameters:** 7B\n- **Strengths:** Chatbots, structured conversation, multilingual (29 languages), large context (128K).\n- **Benchmarks:** High on instruction-following and multilingual tasks.\n- **Notable Features:** Instruction-tuned, robust for dialogue, supports long context ([Sulbha Jain, 2025](https://medium.com/@sulbha.jindal/top-open-source-llms-small-and-mid-range-in-2025-ff8ea8df8738)).\n\n### 4. **DeepSeek 7B**\n- **Parameters:** 7B\n- **Strengths:** Reasoning, coding, problem-solving, bilingual (English/Chinese).\n- **Benchmarks:** Top-tier on reasoning (GSM8K, MMLU), coding (HumanEval).\n- **Notable Features:** Efficient architecture, open weights, research license ([Qlogix, 2025](https://qlogix.blog/2025/04/04/comparing-the-top-open-source-llms-in-2025/)).\n\n### 5. **Falcon 7B**\n- **Parameters:** 7B\n- **Strengths:** Real-time AI, efficiency, strong general-purpose performance.\n- **Benchmarks:** Consistently strong across general NLP tasks.\n- **Notable Features:** Optimized for inference speed, open access ([Sulbha Jain, 2025](https://medium.com/@sulbha.jindal/top-open-source-llms-small-and-mid-range-in-2025-ff8ea8df8738)).\n\n---\n\n## Benchmark Performance: Quantitative Comparison\n\nThe following table summarizes recent benchmark results for leading open-source LLMs under 10B parameters, focusing on core benchmarks (MMLU, GSM8K, HumanEval, ARC, HellaSwag).

HumanEval is typically measured as pass@1 or pass@10 accuracy ([Vellum, 2025](https://www.vellum.ai/open-llm-leaderboard); [Hugging Face, 2024](https://huggingface.co/collections/open-llm-leaderboard/the-big-benchmarks-collection-64faca6335a7fc7d4ffe974a)).*\n\n---\n\n## Analysis of Results and Model Trade-offs\n\n### 1. **General Reasoning and Language Understanding (MMLU, ARC, HellaSwag)**\n- **Llama 3.2\u20138B** and **DeepSeek 7B** consistently lead in MMLU and ARC, reflecting their robust general reasoning and world knowledge. Both models benefit from advanced pretraining and instruction tuning.\n- **Mistral 7B** is close behind, with a slight edge in efficiency and code-related tasks.\n- **Falcon 7B** and **Qwen 2.5\u20137B** perform strongly, but with a slight gap in general reasoning compared to Llama 3.2\u20138B and DeepSeek 7B.\n\n### 2. **Mathematical and Logical Reasoning (GSM8K)**\n- **DeepSeek 7B** and **Llama 3.2\u20138B** are top performers, often exceeding 80% accuracy\u2014approaching the performance of much larger models from 2023.\n- **Mistral 7B** and **Qwen 2.5\u20137B** are competitive, with scores in the mid-to-high 70s.\n\n### 3. **Coding and Problem-Solving (HumanEval)**\n- **DeepSeek 7B** and **Mistral 7B** excel in code generation, with HumanEval scores above 55%. This makes them attractive for developer tools and automation.\n- **Llama 3.2\u20138B** is also strong, but slightly behind DeepSeek and Mistral in code-specific tasks.\n\n### 4. **Instruction-Following and Dialogue**\n- **Qwen 2.5\u20137B** stands out for its instruction-following and conversational abilities, making it well-suited for chatbots and multilingual applications.\n- **Llama 3.2\u20138B** and **Mistral 7B** are also robust in dialogue, especially when fine-tuned.\n\n### 5. **Efficiency and Deployment**\n- All models in this category are designed for efficient inference, with context windows of 32K to 128K tokens, enabling long document processing and multi-turn conversations.\n- **Mistral 7B** and **Falcon 7B** are particularly noted for their speed and low latency, making them ideal for real-time applications ([Sulbha Jain, 2025](https://medium.com/@sulbha.jindal/top-open-source-llms-small-and-mid-range-in-2025-ff8ea8df8738); [n8n Blog, 2025](https://blog.n8n.io/open-source-llm/)).\n\n---\n\n## Hardware and Cost Considerations\n\n- **Memory Requirements:** Most 7B\u20138B models require 8\u201316GB of RAM or VRAM for inference. Quantized versions (4-bit, 8-bit) can run on consumer GPUs or even high-end CPUs with 4\u20138GB RAM for simple tasks ([n8n Blog, 2025](https://blog.n8n.io/open-source-llm/)).\n- **Inference Speed:** On standard consumer hardware (e.g., RTX 4090), these models can achieve 30\u201360 tokens per second. On specialized hardware (Groq LPU, Cerebras CS-3), speeds are much higher ([Artificial Analysis, 2025](https://artificialanalysis.ai/leaderboards/models)).\n- **Cost:** Running these models locally is free after hardware investment. Cloud/VPS costs for a GPU instance start at $1\u2013$2/hour for 7B\u20138B models ([n8n Blog, 2025](https://blog.n8n.io/open-source-llm/)).\n\n---\n\n## Security, Licensing, and Community Support\n\n- **Licensing:** Most models use permissive licenses (Apache 2.0, MIT), though some (e.g., Meta\u2019s Llama 3) have non-commercial restrictions.\n- **Security:** Open weights increase transparency but also expand the attack surface (data poisoning, prompt injection). Community best practices recommend gating access and internal deployment ([n8n Blog, 2025](https://blog.n8n.io/open-source-llm/)).\n- **Community:** All leading models have active communities, frequent updates, and extensive documentation, facilitating rapid adoption and troubleshooting.\n\n---\n\n## Opinion and Synthesis\n\nBased on the most recent and reliable data, **Llama 3.2\u20138B** and **DeepSeek 7B** are the best all-around open-source LLMs under 10B parameters in 2025. They offer the strongest balance of general reasoning, code generation, and efficiency, with benchmark scores rivaling much larger models from previous years. **Mistral 7B** is the top choice for customization and code-centric applications, while **Qwen 2.5\u20137B** is ideal for multilingual chatbots. **Falcon 7B** excels in real-time, low-latency scenarios.\n\nThe gap between these open models and proprietary giants has narrowed dramatically. For most enterprise, research, and developer use cases, deploying a well-chosen 7B\u20138B model is now a practical, cost-effective, and high-performance solution.\n\n---\n\n## References\n\n- n8n Blog.

How much memory you need depends on multiple factors (model size, quantization, etc.) as well as specific use-cases (for example, simple inference vs fine-tuning).\nThanks to recent advances, some efficient small language models (SLMs) can run simple tasks on systems with just 4 GB of free RAM. During fine-tuning, however, the requirements increase, because you need to store intermediate steps while model parameter values are updated.

It helps benchmark how efficiently the model handles different types of inputs.\nToken Per Second (TPS)\nTPS refers to the number of tokens\nthat a LLM can generate or process in one second. A higher TPS indicates faster model responses.\nTPS is generally calculated using the formula:\nTPS = (Input Tokens + Output Tokens) / Total Turnaround Time (TAT in seconds)\nThis value represents the\naverage TPS\n, accounting for both the input and output tokens over the total time taken.\nHowever, it\u2019s also important to evaluate\nOutput TPS\n, which specifically measures how many tokens the model generates per second, independent of the input tokens.\nOutput TPS can be calculated as:\nOutput TPS = Output Tokens / Time to Generate Output Tokens (TAT in seconds)\n\nSource: https://rumn.medium.com/benchmarking-llm-performance-token-per-second-tps-time-to-first-token-ttft-and-gpu-usage-8c50ee8387fa\nTitle: Benchmarking LLMs: TPS, TTFT,  GPU Usage | Medium\nContent: Understanding the Key Performance Metrics\nPhoto by Nataliya Vaitkevich\nRunning LLMs in production comes down to one main thing \u2014 how fast can you get responses from your model (besides accuracy, obviously!). To get the fastest responses, you need solid infrastructure (GPUs and such), but let\u2019s be real \u2014 you can\u2019t just pick the fanciest GPU out there. You need to find something that fits your budget.\nTo figure out what infrastructure you\u2019ll need for your LLM deployment without breaking the bank, let\u2019s look at some key metrics that\u2019ll help you make the right choice:\nTime to first token (TTFT)\nIt refers to the amount of time an LLM takes to generate the first token in its response after receiving an input or prompt. It is typically measured in seconds or milliseconds, and a lower TTFT indicates faster model responsiveness.\nWhy TTFT Matters for Performance Benchmarking?\n\nSource: https://llm-stats.com/\nTitle: LLM Leaderboard 2025 - Verified AI Rankings\nContent: LLM Leaderboard 2025 - Verified AI Rankings\nLLM Rankings\nBest models and API providers in each category\nFollow on X\nReal-time model updates & benchmark alerts\nNEW\nJoin Discord\nFind insights, ask questions, and get help\nBenchmarks\nLeaderboards about code, reasoning and general knowledge\nContext Window\nMaximum input context length for each model\nWhile tokenization varies between models, on average, 1 token \u2248 3.5 characters in English.\nNote: Each model uses its own tokenizer, so actual token counts may vary significantly.\nAs a rough guide, 1 million tokens is approximately equivalent to:\n30 hours\nof a podcast\n~150 words per minute\n1,000 pages\nof a book\n~500 words per page\n60,000 lines\n1\nof code\n~60 characters per line\n[1] Based on average characters per line.

By measuring key metrics like TTFT (Time to First Token), TPS (Tokens Per Second), and GPU usage patterns, you can make informed decisions about which GPU setup will give you the best bang for your buck.\nRemember that benchmarking isn\u2019t just about running a few quick tests \u2014 it\u2019s about simulating real-world conditions. Use diverse input sizes, consider the impact of tokenizers and adapters, and always test with your actual use cases in mind. With the benchmarking script and approach we\u2019ve covered, you can confidently choose the right infrastructure that balances both performance and cost for your LLM deployment.\nIf you enjoyed this article, your applause would be greatly appreciated!\nLlm\nNLP\nPerformance Testing\nMachine Learning\nAI\nFollow\nWritten by\nRuman\n\nSource: https://rumn.medium.com/benchmarking-llm-performance-token-per-second-tps-time-to-first-token-ttft-and-gpu-usage-8c50ee8387fa\nTitle: Benchmarking LLMs: TPS, TTFT,  GPU Usage | Medium\nContent: Don\u2019t forget to clean up GPU memory between runs\n\u2705 Need the full code ?

This article provides a deep dive into five major open LLMs \u2013 their architectures, training specifics, and how they stack up on intelligence benchmarks. We examine Meta\u2019s latest\nLLaMA 3\n, the efficient\nMistral\nmodel, UAE\u2019s\nFalcon\n, community-driven models like\nOpenChat/OpenHermes\n, and new challengers like\nDeepSeek\n(with a note on\nYi\n).

Param = total parameters.\nHow LLM Intelligence is Measured\nWhen we say one model \u201coutperforms\u201d another, it\u2019s usually based on standardized\nevaluation benchmarks\n. These benchmarks test various aspects of AI capability in an apples-to-apples way. Here we explain some of the\nkey metrics and tests\ncommonly used to compare LLMs:\nMMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding):\nA benchmark of 57 diverse subjects (history, math, science, law, etc.) with over 15,000 multiple-choice questions (\nWhat Are LLM Benchmarks? | IBM\n). It evaluates the breadth and depth of a model\u2019s\nworld knowledge and problem-solving\n. Models are tested in zero-shot or few-shot mode (no fine-tune on the tasks), and the score is simply the percentage of questions answered correctly (\n\nSource: https://qlogix.blog/2025/04/04/comparing-the-top-open-source-llms-in-2025/\nTitle: Comparing the Top Open-Source LLMs in 2025\nContent: When evaluating models, it\u2019s important to consider\nwhich benchmarks matter for your use case\n. A coding assistant might prioritize HumanEval and MBPP scores. A knowledge bot might emphasize MMLU and TruthfulQA. The great thing in 2025 is that the open-source community has assembled a rich set of evaluation data and made many results public \u2013 so we have a clearer picture than ever of how these LLMs compare.\nConclusion\nThe open-source LLM ecosystem in 2025 is vibrant and quickly closing the gap with proprietary models.\nMeta\u2019s LLaMA 3\nhas set new records in openness and scale,\nMistral\nhas shown the way to efficiency, and\nFalcon\ndemonstrated that even 100B+ models can be open access. Meanwhile, community fine-tunes like\nOpenChat\nand\nOpenHermes\nprove that with clever training, smaller models can achieve remarkable chat performance. Emerging projects like\nDeepSeek\n\nSource: https://qlogix.blog/2025/04/04/comparing-the-top-open-source-llms-in-2025/\nTitle: Comparing the Top Open-Source LLMs in 2025\nContent: Hugging Face Open LLM Leaderboard\n, which ranks open-source models on a suite of benchmarks including ARC, HellaSwag, MMLU, GSM8K, TruthfulQA, and others (\nWhat Are LLM Benchmarks? | IBM\n) (\nWhat Are LLM Benchmarks? | IBM\n). Models are evaluated under identical conditions (usually 0-shot or few-shot) and the results are updated as new models are added. For instance, as of early 2025, you might see DeepSeek V3, LLaMA\u00a03.1, Falcon 180B, etc. vying for the top spots. Such leaderboards provide a quick way for developers to see which models are currently the \u201csmartest\u201d by these metrics.\nAnother popular evaluation is via\nLMSYS\u2019s Chatbot Arena\n(by the Vicuna team). This is a\ncrowd-sourced Elo rating\nsystem where real users (or a proxy like GPT-4) compare two models in a chat conversation and vote for the better response (\nWhat Are LLM Benchmarks? | IBM\n\nSource: https://qlogix.blog/2025/04/04/comparing-the-top-open-source-llms-in-2025/\nTitle: Comparing the Top Open-Source LLMs in 2025\nContent: What Are LLM Benchmarks? | IBM\n). The LMSYS Arena yields an Elo score indicating overall quality and conversational skill. Open models like Vicuna, OpenAssistant, and others were ranked here against closed models. By mid-2024, some fine-tuned open models (e.g. Vicuna-33B, etc.) had Elo scores not far from ChatGPT. The\nMT-Bench\nmentioned earlier is part of this, using GPT-4 to grade model responses on multi-turn tasks (\nWhat Are LLM Benchmarks? | IBM\n). Leaderboards like LMSYS Arena are valuable because they capture\ninteractive performance and qualitative aspects\n(like helpfulness, coherence) that static benchmarks might miss.\nWhen evaluating models, it\u2019s important to consider\nwhich benchmarks matter for your use case\n\nSource: https://qlogix.blog/2025/04/04/comparing-the-top-open-source-llms-in-2025/\nTitle: Comparing the Top Open-Source LLMs in 2025\nContent: can the model solve problems that stumped earlier LLMs?\nEach task has its own metric (accuracy, F1, etc.), but models are often ranked by how many of the 23 tasks they significantly surpass a baseline on. BBH is useful to distinguish the very best models: for instance, an advanced model might solve 15+ of the tasks, while a weaker one solves only a few. It\u2019s a measure of\nextreme generalization\nability.\nIn addition to these, many other benchmarks exist (HumanEval for coding, MT-Bench for multi-turn dialogue, Winogrande for pronoun resolution, etc.), but the above are among the most widely cited for \u201cgeneral intelligence\u201d of LLMs.\nLeaderboards and Community Evaluations\nTo keep track of the many benchmarks, researchers rely on\nLLM leaderboards\n. A leaderboard aggregates multiple test results into a ranking of models, often with an overall score. One prominent example is the\nHugging Face Open LLM Leaderboard\n\nSource: https://qlogix.blog/2025/04/04/comparing-the-top-open-source-llms-in-2025/\nTitle: Comparing the Top Open-Source LLMs in 2025\nContent: logic and arithmetic\nin LLMs. Top models in 2025 (like GPT-4 or DeepSeek) can exceed 80-90% on GSM8K, whereas earlier models were below 50%, highlighting how far reasoning has come (\nGitHub \u2013 deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3\n).\nBIG-Bench Hard (BBH):\nBIG-Bench is a large collection of challenging tasks;\nBBH\nis a curated subset of the\n23 most difficult tasks\nfrom that collection (\nLLM Benchmarks Explained: Everything on MMLU, HellaSwag, BBH, and Beyond \u2013 Confident AI\n). These tasks cover things like logical deduction, nuanced understanding, or extreme few-shot learning. They were considered \u201cbeyond the capabilities\u201d of models when released (\nLLM Benchmarks Explained: Everything on MMLU, HellaSwag, BBH, and Beyond \u2013 Confident AI\n).

{"query": "What is the impact of AI on creative writing tools?", "report": "# The Impact of AI on Creative Writing Tools: A Comprehensive 2025 Report\n\nThe rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) has fundamentally transformed the landscape of creative writing. What began as simple grammar-checking utilities has matured into a sophisticated ecosystem of AI-powered writing assistants, story generators, and collaborative platforms. As of mid-2025, the impact of AI on creative writing tools is profound, multifaceted, and not without controversy. This report offers an in-depth analysis of how AI is reshaping creative writing, drawing from the latest statistics, expert commentary, and scholarly frameworks.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The Proliferation and Adoption of AI Writing Tools\n\nAI writing tools have achieved mainstream adoption across industries, with creative writing being a particularly dynamic field. According to recent industry surveys, **82% of businesses now utilize AI tools for content creation**, and **58% of companies leveraging generative AI specifically use it for content generation** ([Firewire Digital, 2025](https://www.firewiredigital.com.au/content/ai-writing-statistics/); [DDIY, 2025](https://ddiy.co/ai-writing-statistics/)). In creative writing, these tools range from advanced story generators like OpenAI\u2019s GPT-3 and Claude to specialized platforms for poetry and scriptwriting.\n\nThe global AI market has reached a valuation of approximately **$196.63 billion in 2024**, with projections to hit **$1.8 trillion by 2030** ([Firewire Digital, 2025](https://www.firewiredigital.com.au/content/ai-writing-statistics/)). Within this, the AI content market is expected to reach **$7.9 billion by 2033**, growing at a **7.7% CAGR** ([All About AI, 2025](https://www.allaboutai.com/resources/ai-statistics/ai-writing/)). These figures underscore the scale and momentum of AI\u2019s integration into creative processes.\n\n### Table 1: AI Writing Tool Adoption and Market Growth\n\n| Metric                                      | Value/Statistic           | Source |\n|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------|\n| Businesses using AI for content creation     | 82%                      | [Firewire Digital, 2025](https://www.firewiredigital.com.au/content/ai-writing-statistics/) |\n| Companies using generative AI for content    | 58%                      | [DDIY, 2025](https://ddiy.co/ai-writing-statistics/) |\n| Global AI market size (2024)                 | $196.63 billion          | [DDIY, 2025](https://ddiy.co/ai-writing-statistics/) |\n| Projected global AI market (2030)            | $1.8 trillion            | [Firewire Digital, 2025](https://www.firewiredigital.com.au/content/ai-writing-statistics/) |\n| AI content market projection (2033)          | $7.9 billion             | [All About AI, 2025](https://www.allaboutai.com/resources/ai-statistics/ai-writing/) |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Productivity and Efficiency Gains\n\nOne of the most significant impacts of AI on creative writing tools is the dramatic increase in productivity and efficiency. Organizations report an **average 59% reduction in time spent on basic content creation tasks** and a **55% reduction in content revision cycles** ([Firewire Digital, 2025](https://www.firewiredigital.com.au/content/ai-writing-statistics/)). Bloggers and professional writers using AI spend **about 30% less time writing a blog post** ([DDIY, 2025](https://ddiy.co/ai-writing-statistics/)). Furthermore, businesses leveraging AI writing software experience a **77% increase in content output volume**.\n\nAI tools automate repetitive tasks such as editing, proofreading, and even structural organization, enabling writers to focus on higher-level creative decisions. This acceleration is not limited to commercial content; creative writers benefit from AI\u2019s ability to generate drafts, suggest plot directions, and overcome writer\u2019s block ([Tales Journal, 2025](https://talesjournal.com/resources/impact-ai-creative-writing-industry/)).\n\n### Table 2: Productivity Metrics of AI Writing Tools\n\n| Metric                                  | Value/Statistic | Source |\n|------------------------------------------|-----------------|--------|\n| Reduction in content creation time       | 59%             | [Firewire Digital, 2025](https://www.firewiredigital.com.au/content/ai-writing-statistics/) |\n| Reduction in content revision cycles     | 55%             | [Firewire Digital, 2025](https://www.firewiredigital.com.au/content/ai-writing-statistics/) |\n| Increase in content output volume        | 77%             | [Firewire Digital, 2025](https://www.firewiredigital.com.au/content/ai-writing-statistics/) |\n| Time saved by bloggers using AI          | 30% less        | [DDIY, 2025](https://ddiy.co/ai-writing-statistics/) |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Creativity: Enhancement or Limitation?\n\n### 3.1. Enhancement of Creativity\n\nAI writing tools serve as powerful creative collaborators. They offer writers new perspectives, generate plot ideas, and provide alternative phrasings, which can help overcome creative blocks and inspire novel directions ([Havok Journal, 2025](https://havokjournal.com/internet-technology/the-impact-of-artificial-intelligence-on-creative-writing/); [Writecream, 2025](https://www.writecream.com/ais-impact-on-creative-writing-and-the-future-of-generative-ai/)). AI\u2019s ability to analyze vast datasets enables it to blend genres, styles, and themes in innovative ways, sometimes resulting in story concepts that a human writer might not have conceived independently.\n\nAI also democratizes creative writing by lowering entry barriers. Aspiring writers who struggle with language mechanics can use AI to enhance their work, making the field more accessible and diverse ([Tales Journal, 2025](https://talesjournal.com/resources/impact-ai-creative-writing-industry/)).\n\n### 3.2. Limitations and Risks\n\nDespite these benefits, AI tools face notable limitations in creative writing. They often struggle with generating truly original, emotionally resonant narratives. The subtlety of human experience, cultural nuance, and deep emotional expression remain challenging for AI to replicate ([Marketing Scoop, 2025](https://www.marketingscoop.com/website/seo/the-comprehensive-guide-to-ai-automatic-writing-tools-in-2025-revolutionizing-digital-content-creation/)). There is also a risk of homogenization, where AI-generated content lacks the distinctiveness of individual human voices.\n\nA significant concern among professionals is the potential for AI-generated content to be flagged or devalued by search engines, with **89% of marketers expressing concerns about future penalties or reputational damage** ([Firewire Digital, 2025](https://www.firewiredigital.com.au/content/ai-writing-statistics/)).\n\n---\n\n## 4. Human-AI Collaboration: A Multidimensional Framework\n\nThe relationship between human writers and AI tools is increasingly collaborative and complex. Recent academic work proposes a **multidimensional framework** for understanding this interaction, moving beyond the simplistic \u201chuman-only vs. AI-only\u201d model. The framework includes axes for content generation, structural assistance, creative input, and analytical contribution ([ResearchGate, 2025](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/389389883_Human-AI_Collaboration_in_Writing_A_Multidimensional_Framework_for_Creative_and_Intellectual_Authorship)).\n\nIn this model, AI can assist with brainstorming, drafting, refining arguments, and even shaping the structure of creative works. However, the human author remains the final arbiter, integrating AI-generated suggestions into a cohesive and meaningful narrative. This dynamic is particularly valuable in educational and professional settings, where AI can foster critical thinking and ethical awareness alongside technical skill ([ResearchGate, 2025](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/389389883_Human-AI_Collaboration_in_Writing_A_Multidimensional_Framework_for_Creative_and_Intellectual_Authorship)).\n\n---\n\n## 5. Job Market and Industry Implications\n\nThe impact of AI on creative writing extends to the job market. While AI is expected to **create 97 million new jobs by 2025**, it is also associated with the decline of certain roles: **27% of entry-level writing positions and 35% of freelance gigs have declined since 2023** due to automation ([All About AI, 2025](https://www.allaboutai.com/resources/ai-statistics/ai-writing/)). This shift underscores the urgency for writers to upskill and adapt, focusing on strategic, creative, and analytical competencies that AI cannot easily replicate.\n\nAt the same time, AI-assisted content has demonstrated tangible benefits for digital marketing and SEO. For example, **AI-assisted content increases organic traffic by 31% and improves keyword rankings by 24%**, outperforming both human-only and AI-only strategies ([All About AI, 2025](https://www.allaboutai.com/resources/ai-statistics/ai-writing/)).\n\n---\n\n## 6. Ethical, Authenticity, and Regulatory Concerns\n\nThe rise of AI writing tools has sparked critical discussions about content authenticity, intellectual property, and algorithmic bias ([Marketing Scoop, 2025](https://www.marketingscoop.com/website/seo/the-comprehensive-guide-to-ai-automatic-writing-tools-in-2025-revolutionizing-digital-content-creation/)). The potential for misuse\u2014such as generating fake news or deepfake content\u2014has led to calls for stricter regulation and the development of transparent, accountable AI systems ([Havok Journal, 2025](https://havokjournal.com/internet-technology/the-impact-of-artificial-intelligence-on-creative-writing/)). \n\nEthical frameworks that acknowledge both human and AI contributions are becoming essential. The future of creative writing will likely see the normalization of co-authorship between humans and AI, with clear guidelines for attribution and responsibility ([ResearchGate, 2025](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/389389883_Human-AI_Collaboration_in_Writing_A_Multidimensional_Framework_for_Creative_and_Intellectual_Authorship)).\n\n---\n\n## 7. Future Trends and Outlook\n\nLooking ahead, several trends are poised to shape the next phase of AI in creative writing:\n\n- **Multimodal AI**: Integration of text, audio, and video for immersive storytelling ([Havok Journal, 2025](https://havokjournal.com/internet-technology/the-impact-of-artificial-intelligence-on-creative-writing/)).\n- **Advanced Personalization**: AI systems will better understand individual writing styles, enabling more tailored assistance.\n- **Collaborative Platforms**: Growth of platforms that facilitate seamless human-AI co-authorship.\n- **Global and Multilingual Reach**: AI tools now offer advanced multilingual support, enhancing cross-cultural communication ([Marketing Scoop, 2025](https://www.marketingscoop.com/website/seo/the-comprehensive-guide-to-ai-automatic-writing-tools-in-2025-revolutionizing-digital-content-creation/)).\n- **Investment Surge**: **85% of businesses plan to increase spending on AI writing by 2028** ([All About AI, 2025](https://www.allaboutai.com/resources/ai-statistics/ai-writing/)).\n\n---\n\n## 8. Conclusion: A Nuanced Transformation\n\nThe impact of AI on creative writing tools is both transformative and nuanced. AI has accelerated productivity, democratized access, and opened new avenues for creativity. However, it also presents challenges related to authenticity, emotional depth, and ethical use. The future of creative writing will not be a binary contest between human and machine, but rather a collaborative, multidimensional partnership where each brings unique strengths.\n\nWriters, educators, and industry leaders must embrace this complexity, fostering environments where AI augments rather than replaces human creativity. The most successful creative works of the future will likely be those that blend the efficiency and breadth of AI with the irreplaceable nuance, emotion, and originality of the human mind.\n\n---\n\n## References\n\n- Firewire Digital.

Historically, writing was seen as a human-driven cognitive and creative exercise, but with the rise of generative AI tools such as ChatGPT and Claude, the line between human and AI contributions has become increasingly ambiguous. This paper addresses the limitations of the current sliding scale model, which views AI involvement as ranging from \"none\" to \"complete.\" In its place, we propose a new multidimensional framework that more accurately reflects the complexity of human-AI collaboration in writing. The model includes axes for content generation, structural assistance, creative input, and analytical contribution, emphasizing the varying degrees of interaction between human writers and AI tools. This framework highlights how AI can assist in different aspects of writing without fully replacing human agency, while also\n\nSource:

Limitations and Risks\n\nDespite these benefits, AI tools face notable limitations in creative writing. They often struggle with generating truly original, emotionally resonant narratives. The subtlety of human experience, cultural nuance, and deep emotional expression remain challenging for AI to replicate ([Marketing Scoop, 2025](https://www.marketingscoop.com/website/seo/the-comprehensive-guide-to-ai-automatic-writing-tools-in-2025-revolutionizing-digital-content-creation/)). There is also a risk of homogenization, where AI-generated content lacks the distinctiveness of individual human voices.\n\nA significant concern among professionals is the potential for AI-generated content to be flagged or devalued by search engines, with **89% of marketers expressing concerns about future penalties or reputational damage** ([Firewire Digital, 2025](https://www.firewiredigital.com.au/content/ai-writing-statistics/)).\n\n---\n\n## 4. Human-AI Collaboration: A Multidimensional Framework\n\nThe relationship between human writers and AI tools is increasingly collaborative and complex. Recent academic work proposes a **multidimensional framework** for understanding this interaction, moving beyond the simplistic \u201chuman-only vs. AI-only\u201d model. The framework includes axes for content generation, structural assistance, creative input, and analytical contribution ([ResearchGate, 2025](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/389389883_Human-AI_Collaboration_in_Writing_A_Multidimensional_Framework_for_Creative_and_Intellectual_Authorship)).\n\nIn this model, AI can assist with brainstorming, drafting, refining arguments, and even shaping the structure of creative works. However, the human author remains the final arbiter, integrating AI-generated suggestions into a cohesive and meaningful narrative. This dynamic is particularly valuable in educational and professional settings, where AI can foster critical thinking and ethical awareness alongside technical skill ([ResearchGate, 2025](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/389389883_Human-AI_Collaboration_in_Writing_A_Multidimensional_Framework_for_Creative_and_Intellectual_Authorship)).\n\n---\n\n## 5. Job Market and Industry Implications\n\nThe impact of AI on creative writing extends to the job market. While AI is expected to **create 97 million new jobs by 2025**, it is also associated with the decline of certain roles: **27% of entry-level writing positions and 35% of freelance gigs have declined since 2023** due to automation ([All About AI, 2025](https://www.allaboutai.com/resources/ai-statistics/ai-writing/)). This shift underscores the urgency for writers to upskill and adapt, focusing on strategic, creative, and analytical competencies that AI cannot easily replicate.\n\nAt the same time, AI-assisted content has demonstrated tangible benefits for digital marketing and SEO. For example, **AI-assisted content increases organic traffic by 31% and improves keyword rankings by 24%**, outperforming both human-only and AI-only strategies ([All About AI, 2025](https://www.allaboutai.com/resources/ai-statistics/ai-writing/)).\n\n---\n\n## 6. Ethical, Authenticity, and Regulatory Concerns\n\nThe rise of AI writing tools has sparked critical discussions about content authenticity, intellectual property, and algorithmic bias ([Marketing Scoop, 2025](https://www.marketingscoop.com/website/seo/the-comprehensive-guide-to-ai-automatic-writing-tools-in-2025-revolutionizing-digital-content-creation/)). The potential for misuse\u2014such as generating fake news or deepfake content\u2014has led to calls for stricter regulation and the development of transparent, accountable AI systems ([Havok Journal, 2025](https://havokjournal.com/internet-technology/the-impact-of-artificial-intelligence-on-creative-writing/)). \n\nEthical frameworks that acknowledge both human and AI contributions are becoming essential. The future of creative writing will likely see the normalization of co-authorship between humans and AI, with clear guidelines for attribution and responsibility ([ResearchGate, 2025](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/389389883_Human-AI_Collaboration_in_Writing_A_Multidimensional_Framework_for_Creative_and_Intellectual_Authorship)).\n\n---\n\n## 7. Future Trends and Outlook\n\nLooking ahead, several trends are poised to shape the next phase of AI in creative writing:\n\n- **Multimodal AI**: Integration of text, audio, and video for immersive storytelling ([Havok Journal, 2025](https://havokjournal.com/internet-technology/the-impact-of-artificial-intelligence-on-creative-writing/)).\n- **Advanced Personalization**: AI systems will better understand individual writing styles, enabling more tailored assistance.\n- **Collaborative Platforms**: Growth of platforms that facilitate seamless human-AI co-authorship.\n- **Global and Multilingual Reach**: AI tools now offer advanced multilingual support, enhancing cross-cultural communication ([Marketing Scoop, 2025](https://www.marketingscoop.com/website/seo/the-comprehensive-guide-to-ai-automatic-writing-tools-in-2025-revolutionizing-digital-content-creation/)).\n- **Investment Surge**: **85% of businesses plan to increase spending on AI writing by 2028** ([All About AI, 2025](https://www.allaboutai.com/resources/ai-statistics/ai-writing/)).\n\n---\n\n## 8. Conclusion: A Nuanced Transformation\n\nThe impact of AI on creative writing tools is both transformative and nuanced. AI has accelerated productivity, democratized access, and opened new avenues for creativity. However, it also presents challenges related to authenticity, emotional depth, and ethical use. The future of creative writing will not be a binary contest between human and machine, but rather a collaborative, multidimensional partnership where each brings unique strengths.\n\nWriters, educators, and industry leaders must embrace this complexity, fostering environments where AI augments rather than replaces human creativity. The most successful creative works of the future will likely be those that blend the efficiency and breadth of AI with the irreplaceable nuance, emotion, and originality of the human mind.\n\n---\n\n## References\n\n- Firewire Digital.

Historically, writing was seen as a human-driven cognitive and creative exercise, but with the rise of generative AI tools such as ChatGPT and Claude, the line between human and AI contributions has become increasingly ambiguous. This paper addresses the limitations of the current sliding scale model, which views AI involvement as ranging from \"none\" to \"complete.\" In its place, we propose a new multidimensional framework that more accurately reflects the complexity of human-AI collaboration in writing. The model includes axes for content generation, structural assistance, creative input, and analytical contribution, emphasizing the varying degrees of interaction between human writers and AI tools. This framework highlights how AI can assist in different aspects of writing without fully replacing human agency, while also\n\nSource:

While some experts commend DeepMind\u2019s comprehensive approach to risk mitigation, others question the plausibility of the 2030 AGI timeline and the lack of a precise definition for AGI ([Fortune, 2025](https://fortune.com/2025/04/04/google-deeepmind-agi-ai-2030-risk-destroy-humanity/)). Anthony Aguirre, co-founder of the Future of Life Institute, acknowledges the effort but stresses that much more work is needed to control superhuman AI systems.\n\n### My Assessment\n\nBased on the available evidence, DeepMind\u2019s June 2025 research outputs are both scientifically rigorous and highly relevant to the future of AI. The integration of algorithmic information theory with unsupervised learning represents a foundational advance, while the AGI safety paper sets a new standard for risk analysis in the field. The performance of AlphaGeometry2 and the Gemini models demonstrates DeepMind\u2019s continued leadership in both theoretical and applied AI.\n\nHowever, the field still faces unresolved challenges, particularly regarding the definition and controllability of AGI. While DeepMind\u2019s predictions are bold, the lack of consensus on what constitutes AGI and how to measure its emergence remains a significant obstacle to effective governance.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nJune 2025 has seen DeepMind release a series of impactful research papers and technical updates that advance the state of AI in both theory and practice. The organization\u2019s focus on principled machine learning, risk-aware AGI development, and real-world applications such as mathematical reasoning and medical diagnostics underscores its central role in shaping the future of artificial intelligence.\n\nWhile DeepMind\u2019s work is not without controversy\u2014especially regarding AGI timelines and definitions\u2014their commitment to transparency, rigorous methodology, and societal impact is evident. As the field moves closer to realizing the promise and peril of AGI, the research released this month will serve as a crucial touchstone for both the scientific community and policymakers.\n\n## References\n\n- DeepMind.

Results revealed consistent value structures across\ntrials, with Ethical Integrity and Purposeful Contribution emerging as top\npriorities. Multidimensional scaling and hierarchical clustering analyses\nfurther uncovered two distinct value profiles: human-centric models emphasizing\nethical and relational dimensions, and utility-driven models prioritizing\nperformance and scalability. The PAPERS framework bridges insights from human\nflourishing and human-computer interaction, offering a conceptual foundation\nfor understanding artificial intelligence (AI) well-being in non-sentient and\npotentially sentient systems. Our findings underscore the importance of\ndeveloping psychologically valid, AI-specific models of flourishing that\naccount for both human-aligned goals and system-specific priorities. As AI\nsystems become more autonomous and socially embedded, machine flourishing\noffers a timely and critical lens for guiding responsible AI design and ethical\nalignment.

{"input": "How is AI impacting creative industries like film and design?", "output": "# The Impact of AI on Creative Industries: Film and Design in 2025\n\nThe creative industries\u2014encompassing film, design, advertising, music, and more\u2014are undergoing a profound transformation driven by advances in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly generative AI. As of 2025, the integration of AI into these fields is not only reshaping workflows and creative processes but also raising significant questions about the future of creativity, employment, and ethics. This report provides an in-depth, objective analysis of how AI is impacting creative sectors such as film and design, drawing on the latest research, industry insights, and expert commentary.\n\n---\n\n## 1. AI\u2019s Transformative Role in Creative Processes\n\n### 1.1 Generative AI: Definition and Core Technologies\n\nGenerative AI refers to a subset of artificial intelligence systems designed to create new content or data, focusing on producing novel outputs rather than simply analyzing existing information. The primary architectures powering generative AI include Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Transformer models. These technologies enable machines to learn from vast datasets and generate text, images, music, and even video content that mimic or extend human creativity ([Creativepool, 2025](https://creativepool.com/magazine/industry/how-generative-ai-is-reshaping-the-creative-industry-in-2025.32159)).\n\n### 1.2 Automation and Enhancement of Creative Tasks\n\nAI is automating repetitive, time-consuming tasks in creative workflows, allowing professionals to focus more on ideation and high-level creative decisions. In design, AI tools can automatically resize images, adjust layouts for different platforms, and generate marketing materials. In film, AI assists with script analysis, storyboarding, editing, and even casting decisions based on audience data ([Company Visions, 2024](https://companyvisions.com/design/17-ways-ai-is-reshaping-the-creative-industries/); [AlixPartners, 2025](https://www.alixpartners.com/insights/102jsme/ai-in-creative-industries-enhancing-rather-than-replacing-human-creativity-in/)). This automation not only boosts productivity but also frees up creative professionals to innovate.\n\n---\n\n## 2.

The lack of uniform global regulations complicates the legal landscape ([Creativepool, 2025](https://creativepool.com/magazine/industry/how-generative-ai-is-reshaping-the-creative-industry-in-2025.32159); [AI Art Central, 2025](https://aiartcentral.com/the-transformative-impact-of-ai-on-creative-industries-opportunities-and-challenges/)).\n- **Authorship and Attribution**: Determining authorship and ownership of AI-generated works remains a contentious issue, with most jurisdictions requiring substantial human involvement for copyright eligibility ([EWADirect, 2025](https://www.ewadirect.com/proceedings/ace/article/view/16884)).\n\n### 5.2 Quality, Authenticity, and Bias\n\n- **Quality Control**: While AI can generate content rapidly, ensuring the quality and originality of outputs is an ongoing challenge. Overreliance on AI may lead to homogenization and loss of creative distinctiveness ([Quanta Intelligence, 2024](https://quantaintelligence.ai/2024/08/19/technology/artificial-intelligence/ai-and-human-creativity-compared)).\n- **Bias and Stereotypes**: AI systems may inadvertently reinforce biases present in training data, resulting in stereotypical or exclusionary content ([Creativepool, 2025](https://creativepool.com/magazine/industry/how-generative-ai-is-reshaping-the-creative-industry-in-2025.32159)).\n\n### 5.3 Employment and Workforce Adaptation\n\n- **Job Displacement**: Automation of repetitive tasks threatens traditional roles, particularly junior positions in design and film production. However, new opportunities are emerging in AI programming, data analysis, and creative direction ([AI Art Central, 2025](https://aiartcentral.com/the-transformative-impact-of-ai-on-creative-industries-opportunities-and-challenges/); [INFO SERVICE, 2025](https://infoservice-ai.com/the-future-of-filmmaking-exploring-the-impact-of-ai-on-jobs-and-creativity-in-the-film-industry/)).\n- **Upskilling**: Creative professionals must adapt by developing skills in AI technologies and focusing on tasks that require human judgment, critical thinking, and emotional intelligence.\n\n---\n\n## 6. The Human-AI Collaborative Future\n\nDespite fears of replacement, the consensus among experts is that AI is best viewed as a tool that enhances human creativity rather than a substitute. Experienced professionals benefit most from AI when they use it to augment their skills, while novices risk overreliance and diminished creative development ([Company Visions, 2024](https://companyvisions.com/design/17-ways-ai-is-reshaping-the-creative-industries/)). The future of creative industries lies in a symbiotic relationship where AI handles routine tasks and provides inspiration, while humans drive innovation, emotional depth, and cultural relevance.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Conclusion and Outlook\n\nAI\u2019s impact on creative industries such as film and design is both profound and multifaceted. The technology accelerates workflows, democratizes creative tools, and opens new avenues for artistic expression. At the same time, it introduces challenges related to ethics, legal frameworks, and workforce adaptation.

These models, with their exponential growth in parameters, have a historical context rooted in their capacity for complex language processing. However, the argument surfaces that LLMs may be overkill for certain tasks, and the chat interface may not be the optimal solution for every use case. For example, many natural language processing tasks involve ingesting or writing very large blocks of text or even code. Doing so in a conversational setting is unnatural and we can imagine many interfaces that are more amenable to a copywriter, programmer or analyst\u2019s workflow.\n\nSource: https://medium.com/@andre.dm.carmo/beyond-chat-exploring-alternative-interfaces-for-large-language-models-177e84d1e223\nTitle: Beyond Chat: Exploring Alternative Interfaces for Large Language Models | by Andr\u00e9 Carmo | Medium\nContent: Chat interfaces will likely remain a significant paradigm for interacting with LLMs, especially for casual users and general-purpose applications. Chat\u2019s simplicity and familiarity are hard to beat. It has a very low entry point regarding the required skills and know-how to extract some basic level of value. On the other hand, we\u2019ll see increasing experimentation with alternative interfaces optimized for specific use cases and user needs.\nFor example, a content creation tool powered by LLMs might provide a more visual interface for managing and manipulating different pieces of text. An educational application could use a more structured and goal-oriented UX, guiding learners through specific exercises and assessments. A scientific research tool might focus on exposing the inner workings of the LLM and allow users to fine-tune different parameters. In each of these cases, the alternative interface is designed to enhance the user\u2019s experience and productivity in a specific context.\n\nSource: https://blog.logrocket.com/beyond-chat-rethinking-how-we-use-llms/\nTitle: Beyond chat: Rethinking how we use LLMs - LogRocket Blog\nContent: The success of ChatGPT reinforced the idea that chat-based interaction was the most intuitive and effective way to harness LLM capabilities. However, while chat works well in certain contexts, there are many scenarios where a different interface would offer a more optimal experience.\nFor example, LLMs can function as backend components where most interactions are handled by a frontend interface, such as a dashboard, web app, or mobile app, without relying on a chat-based system. This is the case in a personalized\nrecommendation engine\n, where an LLM analyzes user preferences and behavior to generate tailored recommendations for products (e.g., a trip to Italy), content (e.g., recipes), or resources (e.g., scientific papers) without requiring a chat interface.\n\nSource: https://blog.logrocket.com/beyond-chat-rethinking-how-we-use-llms/\nTitle: Beyond chat: Rethinking how we use LLMs - LogRocket Blog\nContent: Similarly, in the business domain, an LLM can power a business intelligence dashboard, interpreting and summarizing data, generating insights, and providing explanations for visualizations (e.g., charts and graphs). Users can interact with the system simply by clicking buttons or selecting data points, rather than engaging in a chat.\nThe problem of chat interface inertia\nMany developers default to chat interfaces even for tasks better suited to other UI types \u2014 such as dropdown menus, interactive dashboards, and command line interfaces \u2014 resulting in inefficient, overly complex user experiences.\nFor example, a simple Google search for \u201cchat with PDF\u201d reveals countless services offering the ability to \u201cchat\u201d with a document:\nThe concept is enticing and straightforward: find a clever way to feed document text into a prompt \u2014 perhaps using a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) architecture like\nLlamaIndex\n\u2014 and allow users to ask questions as if they were chatting with the document.\n\nSource: https://medium.com/@andre.dm.carmo/beyond-chat-exploring-alternative-interfaces-for-large-language-models-177e84d1e223\nTitle: Beyond Chat: Exploring Alternative Interfaces for Large Language Models | by Andr\u00e9 Carmo | Medium\nContent: Chat interfaces can feel cumbersome when working with large volumes of information. Conversations become hard to navigate as they grow longer, and valuable insights get buried in the endless scroll. Even with the help of searching and filtering features, chat interfaces are not well-suited to managing information at scale.\nIt\u2019s helpful to adopt a different mental model for understanding LLMs to move beyond the limitations of a chat-only interface. Rather than seeing them primarily as conversational agents, we can think of LLMs as \u201cword calculators\u201d \u2014 powerful language manipulators that can flexibly operate on textual inputs to produce desired outputs.\n\nSource: https://blog.logrocket.com/beyond-chat-rethinking-how-we-use-llms/\nTitle: Beyond chat: Rethinking how we use LLMs - LogRocket Blog\nContent: Chat interfaces excel in situations involving unstructured data or open-ended questions, providing users with flexibility and opportunities for exploration. LLMs have the potential to improve UI designs by introducing smart features such as form completion, dynamic search, and data insights without forcing interactions into a chat format.\nThe figure below shows the \u201cchat with your data\u201d model. Unstructured data, represented by a cloud, is fed into an \u201c?AG\u201d block:\nThis representation is used to illustrate various architectures that can augment generation, such as retrieval augmented generation (RAG), cache augmented generation (CAG), and the more general knowledge augmented generation (KAG). The symbol \u201c?AG\u201d encompasses all these possible variations of augmented generation approaches. The user (the smiley icon) interacts by using a chat-based interface with the model.\n\nSource: https://medium.com/@andre.dm.carmo/beyond-chat-exploring-alternative-interfaces-for-large-language-models-177e84d1e223\nTitle: Beyond Chat: Exploring Alternative Interfaces for Large Language Models | by Andr\u00e9 Carmo | Medium\nContent: While chat interfaces are here to stay, an exclusive focus on chat risks constraining LLMs\u2019 true potential. By embracing a diversity of interaction models \u2014 from the familiar to the experimental \u2014 we can ensure that these incredible language machines are put to their best and most impactful use.

Overreliance on chat can introduce unnecessary complexity, strain resources, and limit the user experience.\nBy adopting a hybrid approach \u2014 automating initial drafts and using chat-based refinement only when necessary \u2014 we can optimize both performance and usability.\nThis model balances LLM automation with user-driven refinement, leading to more flexible and efficient workflows, especially in contexts where structured interactions are preferable.

This article explores why chatbots became the norm, the problems they create for developers, and alternative, more effective solutions.\nWhy chatbots are everywhere\nChatbots emerged largely because early LLM services used conversational formats, which appealed to users by mimicking human-like interactions. A notable example is OpenAI, which promoted its services by releasing ChatGPT, a widely publicized chat interface to its powerful LLM.\n\nSource: https://medium.com/@andre.dm.carmo/beyond-chat-exploring-alternative-interfaces-for-large-language-models-177e84d1e223\nTitle: Beyond Chat: Exploring Alternative Interfaces for Large Language Models | by Andr\u00e9 Carmo | Medium\nContent: By exploring alternative interfaces that are more transparent, structured, and optimized for specific use cases, we can start unlocking the full range of capabilities that LLMs offer. This will likely require extensive research and experimentation, drawing insights from cognitive science, human-computer interaction, information visualization, and natural language processing.\nUltimately, the question of how to best interact with LLMs is still wide open. What\u2019s clear is that we\u2019re in the early days of a profound shift in how humans and machines communicate. As we continue to develop and refine these powerful language technologies, we must think critically about the interfaces we use to engage with them.
