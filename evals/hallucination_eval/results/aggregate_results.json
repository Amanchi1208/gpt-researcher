AI can analyze vast datasets of clothing styles, trends, and fabrics. It can then generate original garment designs or suggest modifications based on your preferences. This can be great for senior designers who are experiencing a creative block. With their experience, they can pick and choose the suggestions of AI, and by mixing their own creativity and knowledge, they can come up with great designs.\nBut when a newbie designer who has very little to no experience in designing pieces from scratch starts getting help from AI, they are most likely to just copy and paste the AI-generated ideas. As a result, they end up completely turning off their own imaginations and creative abilities.\nSo, I believe AI has the power to reshape creative industries and make them more efficient, but only when people are treating it as a tool and not a substitute for their creativity.\nSai Viswesh\n, Software Engineer and product lead,\nConsainsights\n\nSource: https://companyvisions.com/design/17-ways-ai-is-reshaping-the-creative-industries/\nTitle: 17 Ways AI is Reshaping the Creative Industries - Company Visions\nContent: 17 Ways AI is Reshaping the Creative Industries - Company Visions\nMenu\nSearch\nSearch\n17 Ways AI is Reshaping the Creative Industries\nExpert Roundup\nNasreen Quadir\nJuly 26, 2024\n13 mins read\nOn this page\nExploring the impact of AI is reshaping the creative industries, we\u2019ve gathered insights from seventeen creative professionals, including Creative Directors and CEOs.
